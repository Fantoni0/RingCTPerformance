# Ring Confidential Transaction Signatures Performance Analysis
Python implementation of the ring confidential transaction signatures used in [Monero](https://github.com/monero-project/monero).
More details about RingCT can bew found [here](https://web.getmonero.org/library/Zero-to-Monero-2-0-0.pdf) on chapter 6.

We present a framework to analyze and compare the performance of ringCT against other well-known cryptographic primitives.

:warning: This is a repository for research purposes. Cryptography is a pretty sensible issue and only reputed and tested sources should be used in a production environment. Use at your own risk!

:warning: Also bear in mind that Monero is a huge and dynamic open source project subjected to changes. The signatures here implemented might change in the future.
